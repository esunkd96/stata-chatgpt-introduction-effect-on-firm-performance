# Data (placeholder)

Raw data are not included due to licensing restrictions (Compustat).  
To reproduce the analysis, place the required `.dta` file(s) in this folder with the expected filename(s), e.g.:

- `case_study_data.dta` — firm–quarter panel with gvkey, datadate, NAICS, fundamentals (revtq, cogsq, atq, ltq, xrdq, invtq, capxy, niq, saleq, etc.).

Update paths in `code/01_cleaning.do` if you use different filenames.
